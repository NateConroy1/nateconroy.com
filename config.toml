content = "I'm a Syracuse, NY native and an alumnus of the University of Rochester, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction. Throughout my career I have grown as a reliable developer, faced with the challenge of fast paced agile environments in which I was expected to write efficient and sustainable code for extremely high traffic services with rigid release schedules. My interests include backend and web application development, balancing my love/hate relationship with distance running, and craft beer (not necessarily in that order).<br><br>Prior to San Francisco I was living in Boston, where I was working as a software engineer at Amazon for Alexaâ€™s automated speech recognition engine. I worked to develop and support new features for the cloud speech-to-text engine that reduced latency and improved recognition accuracy for customers around the world. I gained valuable operational experience in this role as a member of our on-call rotation, in which I investigated and resolved issues that posed risks of delaying critical software releases and impacting customer experience. I was also a member of the release team responsible for deploying new engine versions to production.<br><br>During college I also worked as an intern at Amazon Web Services and Lockheed Martin, where I was fortunate to have been mentored by passionate and talented veterans in my field. I've come to love open-ended problems, and I enjoy the challenge of learning new languages, frameworks, and other technologies."
